### Course Description 

Classical courses on machine learning (ML), artificial intelligence (AI), and signal processing (SP) abide by the following recipe: 
first, they introduce models that well-fit a problem at hand; then, rigorously back up these models with intuition, and finally describe basic algorithms that solve such objectives for learning, inference and estimation.
And in most cases, a gradient-based algorithm is the solution to our problems that saves the day!
