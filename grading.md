The grade is based on the following factors: 

- 5% participation and attendance.
- 10% scribing of notes.
- 15% paper reviews - students will submit a review almost each week. 
- 20% presentations
- 50% final project

The instructor reserves the right to curve the scale dependent on overall class scores at the end of the semester. 
The course has the format of "Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory", but the instructor will probably provide unofficially letter grades.
Any curve will only ever make it easier to obtain a certain letter grade.

### Scribing notes
Every week, a different student (or group of students) will volunteer (otherwise, will be randomly selected) to take notes and prepare a short --but consistent-- note on the material presented each week.
In case the attendance is low, this 10% of the final grade will be transferred to paper reviews (summing to 25%).
A latex template will be shared by the instructor.

### Reviews
Key outcome of this course is be able to read, comprehend and (healthy) criticize research papers. Further, as a bonus, reviewing could potentially lead to final project topic suggestions (after discussion with the instructor).
A successful review should be concise (maximum 2 pages, single column, 11pt): beyond main comments, it should include the summary of the paper, discuss its importance, novelty, clarity, and reveal strengths/weaknesses.

### Final project logistics

Students can team up (up to 3 members per group). 
_The goal of the project is to engage students to research related topics, even beyond the timeframe of the course_. 
I.e., there can be topics for a project that focus on simpler scenaria (say convex optimization), and topics that consider some harder non-convex questions. 
While the former could be potentially finished during the timeframe of the course, the latter could continue after the end of the course (this is the meaning of a _open-ended_ project), and the instructor ``bets'' (and believes) on the self-motivation of the students to continue working on it, after the end of the course.

A project must include: 

- The study of at least 3 research papers, on which the project is based on. 
- The proposal of at least one "open" question: this includes the theoretical analysis of a specific scenario, or the implementation of a ML/AI system for some task in an interesting scenario, or a survey comparison of several algorithms on an interesting task.

The instructor will provide feedback to the students (by appointments + electronic communication).
There will be a "midterm" 5-minute (tentative) pitch from each group (a session will be booked for this purpose - dates are tentative).
After the discussion with the instructor, each group should prepare a four-paged description of the project with: 

- Abstract and Introduction. 
- Description of state of the art (summary and connection of the 3 papers selected, description of strengths and weaknesses and how these have led to the open question). 
- Any preliminary results you have, and what is the plan from now on. 

The project will culminate in a final project report of at least six pages, not including references, in NIPS/ICML format. 
At the end of the course, the group will prepare a 10-15 minute presentation, describing the background and the results they obtained.
Final report dates will be available towards the end of the semester.
